      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> California-born and Texan-bred, I spent most of my life in a suburb outside of Dallas, Texas. My three older sisters and I spent our days swimming at the local community pool, playing sports, and attending high school at Frisco High. I attended college at Ouachita Baptist University, where I majored in Psychology and double-minored in Christian Studies and Math. I spent a few years after school living in the wonderful (albeit windy) city of Chicago, and then moved back to Dallas where I met my lovely husband, Justin! We have been married for just shy of three years, and recently moved to Windsor, Colorado with our American Eskimo, Nikko. Although this is my first foray into the world of computer development, I have learned a TON so far and am so excited to see where it leads me! </p>
